# ATM Simulation
This repository was created in order to implement the requirement on https://github.com/Mitrais/java-bootcamp-working/wiki/ATM-Simulation with some adjustment changes to reflect the consistency behaviour
## The finalized code can be looked at the tags:
- Case 1 is on tag [stage1](https://github.com/madfat/atm_1/tree/stage1)
  - decided to create new branch from tag stage1 to apply the feedback changes [here](https://github.com/madfat/atm_1/tree/stage1_after_review)
- Case 2 is on tag [stage2](https://github.com/madfat/atm_1/tree/stage2)
  - decided to create new branch form tag stage2 to apply the feedback changes [here](https://github.com/madfat/atm_1/tree/stage2_after_review)
- Case 3 is still on development branch [stage3](https://github.com/madfat/atm_1/tree/stage3)
